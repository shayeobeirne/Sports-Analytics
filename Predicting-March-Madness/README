# Project Overview

Using public data to develop a machine learning model that determine what factors are most influential in deciding whether an NCAA DI Men's Basketball Team receives a bid at-large to participate in the annual March Madness Tournament.

## Repository Contents

All of the required files to run the Python Notebook are contained within the repository 'Predicting-March-Madness'.

Files needed to replicate model results:

* March_Madness_Predictions.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook containing Python Code to build model)

* Data (contains 11 csv files needed to run Python Notebook)

Resulting report:

* Predicting_March_Madness.pdf

## Description of Project

This project is an independent reasearch project that employs the use of regression models in an attempt to determine what matters most in the decision to award a DI Men's basketball team with an at-large bid to the annual March Madness Tournament.

## Directions for Model Reproducability

In order to run the Jupyter Notebook:

1. Download 'March_Madness_Predictions.ipynb' and the 'Data' folder and store them in the same directory

2. Open 'March_Madness_Predictions.ipynb' in a text editor
  * Note: python3 and pipenv must be installed locally in order for the code to run properly and to install the necessary package libraries

3. The first cell contains all of the necessary packages. Some packages must be installed, in which case `pip install <package name>` can be run once.

4. Run each cell in chronological order to obtain results.
